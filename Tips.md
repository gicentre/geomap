# Tips #

## Data ##

You can find data for individual countries and their administrative zones from [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/) and [Global Administrative Areas](http://www.gadm.org/). You may wish to simplify this data using [MapShaper](http://mapshaper.org/) or open it in a GIS (Geographic Information System) such as [LandSerf](http://www.landserf.org/).

## Colour ##

geoMap is great for making [choropleth maps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map). Think hard about colour though: [ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer.org/) provides some attractive (and appropriate) colour schemes to help you along.

## Panning and zooming ##

You can add panning and zooming to your map using the [giCentre Utilities](http://www.gicentre.org/utils/). The utilities also have ColorBrewer colour schemes built in, alongside some easy-to-use chart types such as bar charts, line charts and scatter plots.
